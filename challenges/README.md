# Coding Challenges
## Description
We were given a set of coding challenges that I modified to accept user input<br>
They came from <a href = 'https://www.codewars.com'>Codewars</a> and <a href = 'https://www.leetcode.com'>Leetcode</a><br>
Will update with more as I complete them and refactor old challenges with more reponsive and efficient code.

## How to Run
Go To samswaringen.github.io/challenges

# Roadmap
1. Do more difficult coding challenges and post them instead of the easier ones
2. Add way to view code of each challenge on site
3. Style popovers better
4. Improve answer animation
